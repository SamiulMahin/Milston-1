            <h3>Salad </h3>
            
            <p>Slaws are some of the best make-ahead salad recipes out there. Typically made with hearty vegetables like cabbage, kale,
            or broccoli, theyâ€™re sturdy enough to be dressed ahead of time. I like to accent the veggie base with a punchy dressing,
            herbs, and even fruit for maximum flavor.</p>

            <p>Mix 1 tablespoon butter with parsley, garlic and soy sauce.
            Sprinkle steak with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat remaining butter over medium heat. Add steak; </p>

            <h3>Soup </h3>
            
            <p>s a slurpable, soothing, chicken broth-based soup, that's filled with white beans, roasted chicken, savory herbs, and
            hearty root vegetables. It's craveable on cold and rainy days.</p>
